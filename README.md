# EIEIO (eie.io) - Old MacDonald's First Garden App

Believe it or not Old MacDonald started off with a small backyard garden, this was long before he became
obsessed with animals and farming.  This app was the first app he used "back in the day" to help
him track, document, manage information about the plants in his garden; as well as query APIs to
obtain data, tips and other guidance related to the crops in his garden.
